Below is an overview of two self-supervised learning methods implemented in this project: SimCLR and Barlow Twins.

## SimCLR Overview

SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) is a self-supervised learning method that leverages contrastive learning to learn useful image representations without labels. In this approach:

- **Architecture:** A ResNet backbone 15 is used, followed by a projection head that maps the high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Contrastive Loss:** The NT-Xent (Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy) loss is applied to maximize the similarity between different augmented views of the same image while minimizing the similarity between different images.
- **Training Process:** The network is first pretrained on unlabeled data using various augmentations to generate different views. After pretraining, the model is fine-tuned on downstream tasks (like classification or regression), leveraging the learned representations.

## Barlow Twins Overview

Barlow Twins is another self-supervised learning approach that aims to reduce redundancy in the learned feature representations. Its main characteristics are:

- **Architecture:** Similar to SimCLR, a ResNet 15 backbone is used, but with modifications that focus on the redundancy reduction principle.
- **Redundancy Reduction:** Instead of relying on negative samples, Barlow Twins minimizes the redundancy by aligning the cross-correlation matrix of features from two different augmented views of the same image with the identity matrix. This process ensures that the representations are both invariant (similar for the same image) and diverse (different across feature dimensions).
- **Training Process:** The model is pretrained using this objective to ensure that each dimension of the representation captures unique information. Once pretrained, the network is fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

Both methods aim to leverage the abundance of unlabeled data to learn robust and generalizable features that can improve performance on various downstream tasks.
